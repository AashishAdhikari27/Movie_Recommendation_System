# Here's a step-by-step guide to setup git:


    1. For updating/upgrading the ubuntu system at first.

        =>  sudo apt update
            sudo apt upgrade


    2. Now, Install git

        => sudo apt install git
            
            OR

        => sudo apt install git -y


    3. Finally, Verify the Installation:

        => git --version


    4. Now, u need to configure Git username and email (Just one time step):

        =>  git config --global user.name "Your Name"
            git config --global user.email "yourname@example.com"


        NOTE: Replace "Your Name" with your desired Git username and "yourname@example.com" with your email address associated with your Git account. These configurations will be used for all your Git repositories.
    

# To store git credentials permanently in ubuntu:

    1. Open a terminal window.

    2. Run the following command to create a credential helper:

       ==> git config --global credential.helper store

    3. Verify that the credential helper is set to store:

       ==> git config --global credential.helper

    4. Enter your username and password for the repository you want to store the credentials for.
        --> Enter your username and password, which you have recently stored in the “~/.git-credential” file as plain text, in the case when you pull or push from the remote repository for the first time.
        (i.e suru ko first time ma halna parna sakcha)

    5. Save the changes.


    Once you have completed these steps, you will no longer be prompted for your credentials when you interact with the repository from the Ubuntu terminal.
